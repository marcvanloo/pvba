# A hashtag (#) indicates a comment, R ignores everything that comes after

# Create a vector containing the ages of 5 students
c(22.4, 21.5, 23.7, 21.8, 20.8)

# Assign this vector to the name 'age' so that we can reuse it
age <- c(22.4, 21.5, 23.7, 21.8, 28.8)

# Type the object name to print its content
age

# R is case-sensitive (note the error messages)
Age
AGE

# Read the help file for the mean() function
?mean

# Calculate the mean age in years
mean(age)

# Remember to close the parentheses
mean(age
)

# Store the mean age in an object named 'mean_age'
mean_age <- mean(age)

# Print the mean of 'age'
mean_age

# Use the assignment operator '<-', not the equal sign '='
# mean_age = mean(age)

# Now press the up and down arrows on your keyboard
